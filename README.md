This is my “Inspiration Card,” inspired by Oblique Strategies. When I work on conceptual or speculative projects, the ideation process often drives me crazy—it usually starts with abstract hypotheses and wild experimentation, then narrows down to a tangible outcome. That’s why I created this app: to help artists and creatives break out of fixed thinking patterns and approach their work from fresh, unexpected angles.

There are just two simple steps. First, the app generates a random sentence based on the style you choose—either Nature or Surrealism. Each sentence is built from randomized combinations of < subjects, verbs, adjectives, and objects>. The background changes accordingly: Nature has a soft, warm tone, while Surrealism comes with cooler, more mysterious colors.
Then second, you pick a task type—this can be just for reading or actually used for creation. Once you click “Generate,” a sentence and a creative task will appear on the card. You can keep pressing the button to get new combinations.
The sentence is usually abstract and illogical, but the task is very specific. This helps artists approach their work from surprising, unconventional angles.
